# Delivery Man Lab Assignment

You will compete in the Delivery Man game. You will be expected to use the A* algorithm to find
optimal routes to work out what moves you should make in the game. Read the runDeliveryMan
help documentation in the DeliveryMan package for more detail. A* will permit you to find the
optimal route between two points given current traffic conditions. This is important, but not the
only important matter in performing well in the game. You will have to think about what else is
important and how you can perform you deliveries as well as possible.
